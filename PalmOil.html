        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>Almost every product we use has a high probability of having palm oil as one of its ingredients, which makes
          palm oil as one of the most consumed vegetable oil, and also a highly controversial ingredient. The annual
          production of palm oil accounts for about 58.84 million tonnes, with Indonesia and Malaysia contribution for
          85 per cent of total produce (Eco-Business, 2017). The demand for palm oil is always increasing as it
          produces much more oil per area in comparison to other vegetable oils. This increased demand comes at a
          cost, not only monetary, but in terms of human rights violations, child labour, modern day slavery,
          extinction of wildlife, and likely possible adulteration (Conflict Palm Oil. (n.d.)).
        </p>

        <p>As of today, Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), a not-for-profit organization certifies sustainable
          palm oil companies which comply to a set of environmental and social criteria, but there’s no way for
          consumers to know if it is RSPO certified and/or sustainable. We propose blockchain as a solution to cater
          to traceability of sustainable palm oil, adding transparency to the supply chain, creating value to
          stakeholders, and empowering consumers to make informed decisions.
        </p>
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>Blockchain technology will provide a tamper proof way of keeping records during various stages of the
          sustainable palm oil supply chain, starting from farms to retail outlets. It will enable tracking and
          managing the origin, intermediary processes, logistics, manufacturing, and distribution, which would result
          in enhanced consumer trust. We would be using a combination of IoT and blockchain technology to achieve a
          cost-effective and efficient solution. IoT layered with sensors and mobile devices/electronics will provide
          crop quality, temperature, storage and distribution information. The blockchain layer will keep all
          information intact from one stage to another in the entire supply chain. </p>

        <h2>Consortium</h2>

        <p>Since there are multiple stakeholders in the palm oil supply chain, the information can be lost or tampered
          with along the various channels in the supply chain. The proposed solution which is heavy on technology and
          involves various participants – a consortium blockchain with controlled user groups of palm oil companies
          will provide a trusted consensus as multiple palm oil companies will have a stake in the outcome. It will
          facilitate a shared build, cost, and time, leading to build a faster and cost-effective solution. Even
          smaller players in the industries can join the consortium solution to reap the benefits of blockchain
          technology and IoT sensors.</p>
        <h2>Hyperledger Sawtooth</h2>

        <p>Hyperledger Sawtooth being an enterprise solution suits the needs of a consortium for a sustainable palm
          oil supply chain. A private permissioned Hyperledger Sawtooth would add more credibility with chaincodes
          (smart contracts) enabling consortia to have restricted control over the network. Multi-language support
          feature will provide flexibility around infrastructure in terms of software languages, where different
          organizations can adopt Python, JavaScript, Rust, C++, and Go to develop chaincodes. It will facilitate an
          easily changeable consensus algorithm without impacting the blockchain network. Additionally, there would
          not be much dependency between various blocks, adding more flexibility when making changes at a local level.
          Companies and consortia can make policy decisions that support their business needs. This would lead to a
          decrease in the scope of errors, enhance simplified implementation, and maintenance of the network. With a
          high demand and volume of palm oil transactions between various channels in the supply chain, parallel
          scheduling will increase productivity and performance.</p>

      <div class=section id=details>
        <h2>Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET)</h2>

        <p>PoET consensus mechanism will provide a fair chance to all the players in the consortia, irrespective of
          their size and power, to become the block leader and produce a new block. Randomized timer systems for the
          players in consortia will ensure more efficiency by removing the need for intensive mining. The random
          selection will mitigate the risks of any bad players from producing the block. Additional security measures
          can be implemented such as watching for a specific node winning the lotteries frequently or having shorter
          timers where it reflects that there is a consistent pattern.</p>
        <h2>Key players</h2>

        <p>Our key players are farmers, plantation owners, oil mill owners, refinery owners, retailers, and consumers.
          Permissioned participants will have access to either write or read the transaction information. The
          communication between various processes in a sustainable palm oil supply chain and blockchain will be
          facilitated by a digital layer. The consumers will be able to scan the QR code on their mobile devices and
          get all the information required to ensure sustainability and they will be able to trace the palm oil
          origins.</p>

        <h2>On-chain and off-chain</h2>

        <p>To enhance performance and scalability of our suggested solution, we will be managing data by using
          off-chain as a storage mechanism. This will ensure more security as data will not be publicly accessible and
          it can bring huge value as it is not limited by transaction delays that are part of on-chain transactions.
        </p>

      <div class=section id=FAQ>
        <h2>Generating revenue</h2>
        <p> The consortia would be bearing the cost of implementation for promoting sustainable palm oil solution for
          an initial five-year duration. Farmers and small key players can join the network for free and later they
          can pay a minimal renewal fee set by the consortia. This duration will enable small players to cultivate the
          benefits of more sales, yielding better crop quality, and ensuring environmental ways of producing crops.
          Consumers will be able to donate voluntary funds to the farmers by tracking the origin of the crops, which
          would empower farmers economically and socially. Retailers can engage consumers in promoting the sale of
          sustainably sourced palm oil products.</p>
        <h2>Potential risks</h2>
        <p>Having talked about the potential of blockchain empowered sustainable palm oil supply chain, there are a
          few risks which must be taken into consideration before implementing the solution. Since it is a diverse and
          multi-faceted supply chain which could spread across different countries, it could lead to different
          regulation challenges making it more difficult or time consuming to implement. Adoption of blockchain
          technology could be another challenge by small key players due to lack of trust or awareness of the
          technology. Educating stakeholders can be time and effort consuming which could potentially delay the
          solution from reaching the markets.</p>
        <h2>Existing competition in the market</h2>
        <p> RSPO certifies sustainable palm oil companies. As of today, 19% of palm oil is globally certified by the
          RSPO (RSPO. (n.d.)). There is still a bigger chunk of palm oil which goes uncategorized. Our blockchain
          solution can help fill the gap by onboarding small and big players in the industry and at the same time,
          ensuring that it is sustainably sourced. Recently there have been some investigations to evaluate the
          effectiveness of RSPO’s in achieving sustainability goals, but lack of insufficient evidence led to
          questioning its credibility. With our blockchain based solution, tamper-proof data can always be used for
          auditing and enforce consumer’s faith in sustainably sourced palm oil products.</p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Tracing the origin of products has been one of the most talked about use cases for blockchain technology
          (Supply Chain Management. (n.d.)). As part of our suggested solution, we [the consortia] have huge faith in
          the potential of blockchain technology to track sustainably sourced palm oil throughout the entire supply
          chain. As of today, customers pay for sustainable palm oil products, but they do not have any insights
          whether or not the product is sustainable. Capturing the information right from the farms to the retail
          outlets, will add transparency to the palm oil ecosystem. Since this information would be tamper-proof,
          there would be no road blocks in gaining trust of consumers and other stakeholders involved in the supply
          chain. Efforts on technology adoption and educating consumers on sustainability can help us leverage the
          potential of this solution to the maximum.</p>
